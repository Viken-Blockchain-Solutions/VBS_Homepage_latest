**Interviewer:**  
Hi Ivo, thanks for chatting with us today! I've heard some exciting newsâ€”Allora Finance has been shortlisted for Request Network's **Best Ecosystem Project** award. That must feel great!

**Ivo (Founder):**  
It really does! We're thrilled about this recognition. It validates all the hard work our team has put into creating something truly valuable for our users.

## The Problem Allora Finance Solves


**Interviewer:**  
So what exactly inspired you to create Allora Finance? What problem were you trying to solve?

**Ivo:**  
It came from my own daily struggles as an entrepreneur and freelancer. I was juggling four or five different apps just to handle basic business tasks! One app for creating invoices, another for tracking time, a separate one for managing my projects, and yet another for accounting. It was such a headache switching between them all, and I kept thinking, "There must be a better way."

/>

<br />

**Interviewer:**  
I think many freelancers can relate to that. What was the real impact of using so many different tools?

**Ivo:**  
The biggest issue was losing money without even realizing it. I'd forget to bill for hours I worked because they weren't properly tracked. Or I'd miss following up on unpaid invoices because that information was in a different system. Not to mention the time wasted just toggling between apps! When you're a freelancer or running a small business, that lost time and revenue really adds up.

## How Allora Makes Life Easier

**Interviewer:**  
So how does Allora Finance solve these problems?

**Ivo:**  
We've created one simple platform that does it all. You track your time, manage your projects, and create professional invoicesâ€”all in one place. Everything connects naturally, so the hours you log automatically appear in your invoices. You can accept payments in regular currency or crypto, whatever works for your business. And the dashboard gives you a clear picture of everything: which projects are on track, which clients need to pay, and how your business is performing overall.

<br />

**Interviewer:**  
Let's talk about Request Network, which Allora Finance uses for payments. What made you choose this particular protocol?

**Ivo:**  
I actually worked directly with Request Network as a DeFi Engineer back in 2021, and I've personally been using their platform for my own invoicing ever since. Their system makes accepting crypto payments simple, even for people who aren't tech experts. Plus, it automatically tracks when payments come in and keeps your invoices legally compliant worldwide. These features were exactly what Allora users needed, so integrating with Request Network was a natural choice.

<br />

**Interviewer:**  
What's your favorite feature that helps users manage their work better?

**Ivo:**  
The project dashboard, hands down! When you're juggling multiple clients and projects, it's easy to lose track of what needs attention. Our dashboard shows you exactly where each project stands compared to your original estimate. You can instantly see if you're about to go over budget or miss a deadline, so you can address issues before they become problems. Our users tell us this visibility has completely changed how they manage their client relationships.

## Who Benefits Most from Allora?

**Interviewer:**  
Who are the typical Allora users? What kinds of businesses benefit most?

**Ivo:**  
We built Allora specifically with freelancers and small businesses in mindâ€”across a wide range of industries. Some of our users are software developers working on short-term, fixed-price assignments. Others are designers or consultants handling longer-term, hourly projects that span several months. We also support service providers who manage ongoing contracts and invoice their clients monthly. The one thing they all share is a strong desire to cut down on paperwork and administrative tasks, so they can spend more of their valuable time doing the work they enjoy and growing their business.

## Looking to the Future

**Interviewer:**  
What's been the most satisfying moment since launching Allora?

**Ivo:**  
While we're still in early stages with just a dozen users, the most satisfying part has been seeing the platform working as intended. When we observe users actually navigating the system and completing tasks without any hiccups, that's incredibly rewarding. The feedback we've received so far has been invaluableâ€”it's helping us refine features and prioritize what to build next. Seeing real people solving real problems with something we built is what keeps us motivated.

<br />


<br />

**Interviewer:**  
What exciting developments can users look forward to?

**Ivo:**  
We're working on some game-changing features! A major addition will be team management functionality, where businesses can add team members and issue monthly or custom payrolls in both local currency and cryptocurrencies of their choice. This is something our users have specifically requestedâ€”the ability to pay their contractors or employees with the same simplicity they experience with invoicing clients.

We're also expanding our crypto payment options to support more blockchains, and developing AI tools that will help users create more accurate project estimates. Our roadmap is largely shaped by user feedbackâ€”we're constantly listening to what our community needs and adapting accordingly.
