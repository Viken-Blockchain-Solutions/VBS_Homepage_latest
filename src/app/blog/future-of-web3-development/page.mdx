## 1. AI Assisted Development

![](./pilot.jpg)

The launch of Github Copilot in 2022 gave us a glimpse of what it would look like to have AI assistance directly in your IDE. This has been a game-changer for many developers, providing a new level of support and efficiency in coding. In 2023, we expect these AI assistants to become even more sophisticated, with tools like Alchemy Plugin and Web3 User Activity Plugin leading the way.

## 2. Web3 DApps and Wallets

The rise of Web3 DApps and wallets, especially Metamask, is revolutionizing the way we interact with blockchain technologies. These tools are streamlining many processes, from transaction verification to smart contract execution. With the growing popularity of Metamask, we predict a significant increase in the use of Web3 wallets in 2023.

## 3. Web3 and Blockchain Tools

As we move into the era of Web 3.0, we're seeing a shift towards decentralization. This new generation of the web allows content creators to profit more directly from their work, with payments often made in cryptocurrencies and ownership verified by public entries on a blockchain.

These are just a few of the exciting developments we expect to see in the world of web3 development in 2023 and beyond. As technology continues to evolve, we can look forward to a future where the web is more decentralized, interactive, and immersive than ever before.
