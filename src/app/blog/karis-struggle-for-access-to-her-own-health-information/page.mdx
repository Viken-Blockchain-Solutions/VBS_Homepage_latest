Kari, a 60-year-old from a picturesque Norwegian town, has been navigating health challenges, leading her to multiple medical consultations. This journey has resulted in a myriad of patient records dispersed across various healthcare systems.

Upon learning of an upcoming appointment with a new specialist, she's determined to provide a holistic view of her medical history. Despite her efforts, consolidating her health data becomes an overwhelming endeavor.

She finds her records in both paper and digital formats, with some inaccessible or requiring individual institution outreach. This tedious process frustrates Kari, who wishes to be proactive about her health.

At the clinic, a secretary informs her of the specialist's incomplete view of her medical history. Missing recent test results and notes, the appointment faces postponement. Kari's anxiety rises, recognizing the implications of potential treatment delays and misdiagnoses.
