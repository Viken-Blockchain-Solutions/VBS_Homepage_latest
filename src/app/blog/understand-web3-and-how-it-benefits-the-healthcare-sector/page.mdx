## Introduction

The current version of the internet, Web 2.0, is centralized, meaning that companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon have control over the data we store and share online. This can lead to privacy and security issues as our personal information is vulnerable to cyber-attacks and misuse.

Web3 aims to change this by creating a more decentralized internet. Instead of relying on a few large companies to store and control our data, Web3 uses blockchain technology to create a distributed database network that is more resistant to tampering and hacking. This allows us to regain control over our data and have more of a say in how it is used.

<TopTip>
  Web3 also opens up new possibilities for online interactions, including user-to-user transactions and decentralized applications (dApps) 
  running on the blockchain. These dApps can be used for everything from social networks to games to financing and have the potential to 
  innovate how we interact with each other and the information we share on the network.

## 2. Turnover: a Fresh Perspective

We parted ways with almost all of our senior development team within the first month of going back to the office, due to some irreconcilable differences. Stressed and worried, we decided to try turn this into a positive.

Luckily for us, it was the same week that CoPilot launched and we were able to replace everyone with five bootcamp graduates all logged into one Github account.

We have been consistently surprised at the fresh energy these new grads brought to our organisation and have since vowed to never hire anyone with more than 3 months experience again.

## 3. Cost Efficiency

Demand is at an all time low for commercial real-estate, which means it’s never been more affordable to cram forty people into an open plan office.

What’s more, is we’ve found that we can offer extremely low-cost perks like a snack cupboard or free beer in-lieu of higher salaries. For every foosball table we buy, we find we can offer around 5% less salary per job posting. Our full-time barista is the highest paid employee, after management.
