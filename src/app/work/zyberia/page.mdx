## Introduction

Zyberia, a pioneering HealthTech company from Norway, has developed HealthB, a personal health platform designed to empower users to collect, understand, and communicate their health data. Their vision is to help people own their health and improve their quality of life. As the digital health landscape evolves, the integration of blockchain and Web3 technologies presents a transformative opportunity. This is where VBS steps in.

## The Problem Addressed by HealthB

Health data is often fragmented across various systems, making it challenging for individuals to have a comprehensive view of their health. Without this aggregate overview, proactive health management becomes a challenge. Furthermore, a significant portion of medical advice is forgotten shortly after a doctor's visit, hindering effective self-care.

## The HealthB Solution

With HealthB, users get an aggregate overview of their health data, enabling them to:

- Collect, understand, and communicate their health.
- Navigate and co-create in the healthcare system.
- Access features like Health Summary, Allergies, Diagnosis List, Medicines List, Personal Notes, and share health data via QR Code.

## The VBS Contribution

Recognizing the challenges and the potential of HealthB, VBS collaborated with Zyberia to integrate blockchain technology, offering:
