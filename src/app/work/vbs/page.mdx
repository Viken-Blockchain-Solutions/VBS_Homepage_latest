## Overview

From our inception, Bjørn Tollefesen and I, Ivo Garofalo, recognized the transformative potential of blockchain technology, particularly within the healthcare sector. VBS - Viken Blockchain Solutions AS was founded on a mutual vision to utilize this technology to address pressing challenges in healthcare data management. Bjørn's unwavering commitment and motivation have been foundational, solidifying our partnership and friendship.

### In the healthcare sector in Norway, we identified:

1. A fragmented control over personal health records.
2. Challenges in seamlessly sharing these records among healthcare professionals.
3. Protracted processes for professionals to retrieve these records.
4. Inefficient systems for patient arrival registration.

### Leveraging the expertise of our CTO, Christian Cole, VBS devised a blockchain-centric solution. Our objectives were:

1. Ensuring secure and private storage for patient data.
2. Facilitating streamlined access to this data for both patients and healthcare professionals.
3. Guaranteeing secure transmission of patient information.
4. Automating repetitive tasks for healthcare professionals.
5. Reducing human errors and potential security vulnerabilities.
